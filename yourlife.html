2|I was examining a strange tome I found in an abandoned library when the entity that would become my patron suddenly appeared before me
3|I stumbled into the clutches of my patron after I accidentally stepped through a magical doorway.
4|When I was faced with a terrible crisis, I prayed to any being who would listen, and the creature that answered became my patron.
5|My future patron visited me in my dreams and offered great power in exchange for my service.

<span data-type="roll" data-sides="6">d6</span>|I became a wizard because...
1|An old wizard chose me from among several candidates to serve an apprenticeship.
2|When I became lost in a forest, a hedge wizard found me, took me in, and taught me the rudiments of magic.
3|I grew up listening to tales of great wizards and knew I wanted to follow their path. I strove to be accepted at an academy of magic and succeeded.
4|One of my relatives was an accomplished wizard who decided l was smart enough to learn the craft.
5|While exploring an old tomb, library, or temple, I found a spellbook. I was immediately driven to learn all I could about becoming a wizard.
6|I was a prodigy who demonstrated mastery of the arcane arts at an early age. When I became old enough to set out on my own, I did so to learn more magic and expand my power
