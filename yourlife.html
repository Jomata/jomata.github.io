4|I need to prove my worth to my fellow Sherrifs.
5|Someone I cared for died under suspicious circumstances. I will find out what happened to them and bring their killer to justice.

1|I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.
2|I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.

8|I was, in fact, raised by wolves.

1|I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants
2|There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.

4|I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
5|Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
6|Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.
